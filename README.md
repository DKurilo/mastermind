# mastermind

Here is simple [mastermind game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) implementation I did for [functional programming in Haskell course](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/functional-programming-haskell/8).  
For computer as codebreaker Knuth algorithm was used. So most probably you have no chance against computer. Sorry. :)
